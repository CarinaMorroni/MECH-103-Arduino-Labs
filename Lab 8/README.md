# Force Sensor Arduino

*This Lab:*
* Converts the voltage determined by the force sensor into the force of an object on the fors sensor
* Turns on various lights, depending on how much force is on the sensor
* Approximates the volume of water it would take to turn on each set of lights (related to the force of the water on the force sensor)

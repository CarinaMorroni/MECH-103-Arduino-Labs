# MECH 103 Arduino Labs
*These are Labs that I completed in the MECH 103, Introduction to Mechanical Engineering class, at Colorado State University, unsing an arduino.*

## Repository Contents
* Lab 6: Using the Arduino to write in Morse Code
* Lab 8: Using a Force Sensor to turn on different LED lights, depending on the volume of liquid placed on the Force Sensor
* Lab 9: Using and Ultrasonic Sensor to determine how far an object is away from the arduino, and turning on various LED lights depending on the distance
